GAL
===

Description:
------------
GAL stands for GRL Assembly Language.  A very simple and programmer unfriendly
language.  Parsing is very trivial and the execution is brain dead easy.  The
language is interpreted.

Language:
---------
Rules:
1. There can only be one instruction per line.
2. Blank first character means what follows is a comment.
3. The instruction must start at the first character.
4. The command doesn't need a prefix.
5. The parameters of the command all need a prefix to indicate what type of 
   parameter is involved

Types:
------
The following are the names of the types used for the type parameter when
defining a variable.  Variables are only local to the module they are defined
in.

sa             - A dynamic ASCII string. 
su             - A dynamic UNICODE string
i1, i2, i4, i8 - An integer of 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes.
n1, n2, n4, n8 - A natural of 1, 2, 4 and 8 bytes.
r4, r8         - real of 4 and 8 bytes.
p              - pointer

Prefix:
-------
What's a prefix.  It's a letter indicating what the [value] is that follows.  
This is only needed for [value] below.

" - what follows is a string and needs to be set verbatum till end of line.  
    Does not include new line in string.
' - just leave the token as is.  The token becomes a string but will stop at
    the first whitespace.
i - what follows is an integer.
n - what follows is a natural.
r - what follows is a real.
v - what follows is a variable.

Operations:
-----------
Variable Creation:
v [type] [name]+
   type is one of the types.
   There can be more than one name.  All names will have the same type.
   Names must start with a letter.  The program isn't fussy what characters
   are used but caution would be advised.
   
   EG:   v 'i4 'index 'count 'voxal
         v 'su 'name 'title 'carName 'balloonName

Assignment:
= [dest] [value]
   destination must be a variable.
   value can be a variable or actual value.
   
   EG:   = vdestination i40
         = vname        "Harry Potter

Math:
+ [dest] [value] [value]+
- [dest] [value] [value]+
* [dest] [value] [value]+
/ [dest] [value] [value]+
   destination must be a variable.
   value must be 0 or more.  
   for + and -, no value means, ABSOLUTE and NEGATE the destination.
   for all, one value means [destination] = [destination] op [value]
   
   EG:   + vdestination vdestination i1 
            
   destination = destination + 1
   
   EG:   + vdestination vvalue i40
       
   destination = value + 40
   
Bit Operations:
>> [dest] [value] [value]
<< [dest] [value] [value]
~ [dest] [value]
| [dest] [value] [value]+
& [dest] [value] [value]+
   for | and & the behaviour is like the similar math functions.
   these functions only work on N and I variable types.
   
   
Logic:
|| [dest] [value] [value]+
&& [dest] [value] [value]+
! [dest] [value]
   These functions only work on N and I variable types.

Desision Control:
if [value]
...
else
...
endif
   There is no else if.  Mainly because it is difficult enough to fill in value.  
   As a reault only an if.  if's can be nested.
   
Loop Control:
loop
...
endloop
   There is no for loop.  Just a simple loop.  Loops can be nested.
   
Function Control:
call [dest] [function] [value]*
   dest is the variable to hold the return data.  Use just a ' if you want to
   ignore the the return value.
   
   function is the name of the GAL script to load up next and run.  If the 
   GAL script is in a different directory then use dir/name
   
   value will be the parameters into the function.
   
param [dest] [intvalue]
   Get a value of the parameter and store it into a variable.
   
return [value]
   return the given value.
   

Examples:   
---------

Hello World!:

   call ' 'sys/print "Hello World!
   call ' 'sys/printNewLine
   return i0
   
   Note a string will run till the end of line.  If you need multiple parameters
   then you will need to put the string into a variable first or break up the
   calls.
   
   Call the file using...
